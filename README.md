## Projects

### 1. [Virus Spread Simulation & Animation](https://github.com/dvodka/portfolio_2023/tree/2b6b4a0b6869dde1c4eb480ba9d1a81868fb226d/project_1)

In this project, I developed a virus spread simulation using object-oriented programming principles. I utilized Matplotlib to create animated visualizations that effectively demonstrated the dynamics of virus propagation. By applying my programming skills and data visualization techniques, I was able to provide an insightful and educational tool for understanding the spread of infectious diseases.

- **Skills:** Object-oriented Programming, Data Visualisation with Matplotlib

### 2. [German Govt. Portal Scraper](https://github.com/dvodka/portfolio_2023/tree/9398fd7bfba0cb2d6fadc3e42ad9457c6ed781d8/project_2)

In this project, I developed a data analysis solution using Python to uncover insights from the German government portal's data on insolvency proceedings and announcements. I utilized web scraping tools like Selenium and BeautifulSoup to efficiently collect relevant data. Using Pandas, I organized and cleaned the data for meaningful analysis.

By enriching the dataset with information about the population of cities and regions, I created insightful visualizations to better understand the insolvency landscape. These visualizations, including bar charts and geographical scatter plots, provide a clear overview of insolvency rates and counts across cities and states in Germany.

To ensure a lightweight and efficient testing process, I chose Plotly's visualizations, which offer interactivity and easy exploration of the geospatial data. This approach allowed me to quickly generate visual representations of insolvency data on a map and gain insights into regional trends.

In essence, this project exemplifies a simple case of step-by-step process of gaining, cleaning, manipulating, analyzing, and visualizing data.

- **Skills:** Data Scraping with Selenium and BeautifulSoup, Data Manipulation with Pandas, Data Visualisation with Plotly and Matplotlib


### 3. [Twitter Sentiment Analysis](https://github.com/dvodka/portfolio_2023/tree/4ea1cbef7dc40bee8a6e258b821822a0881a3387/project_3)

In this project, I tackled the task of Twitter sentiment analysis using natural language processing (NLP) techniques. The goal was to determine the sentiment (positive, neutral, or negative) expressed in a collection of tweets. Sentiment analysis is a valuable application of NLP that has a wide range of applications, from brand monitoring to public opinion tracking.

I leveraged the power of the spaCy library to preprocess the text data, which involved lowercasing, removal of special characters, URLs, mentions, and filtering out non-noun words. The dataset was loaded from a CSV file, missing values were handled, and sentiment labels were mapped.

After preparing the dataset, I split it into training and testing sets and vectorized the text data using the CountVectorizer. I then trained two different classifiers: a Support Vector Machine (SVM) and a Random Forest Classifier. The accuracy of each classifier was evaluated using the test dataset.

Finally, I showcased the trained classifiers by predicting the sentiment labels for a set of example tweets. Although this code is relatively simple, it demonstrates the foundational steps of sentiment analysis using NLP and machine learning. This project demonstrates my knowledge in NLP, data preprocessing, feature extraction, and machine learning techniques.

- **Skills:** Natural Language Processing (spaCy), Data Preprocessing, Feature Extraction, Machine Learning (SVM, Random Forest), Model Evaluation
