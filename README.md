## Projects

### 1. [Virus Spread Simulation & Animation](https://github.com/dvodka/portfolio_2023/tree/2b6b4a0b6869dde1c4eb480ba9d1a81868fb226d/project_1)

In this project, I developed a virus spread simulation using object-oriented programming principles. I utilized Matplotlib to create animated visualizations that effectively demonstrated the dynamics of virus propagation. By applying my programming skills and data visualization techniques, I was able to provide an insightful and educational tool for understanding the spread of infectious diseases.

- **Skills:** Object-oriented Programming, Data Visualisation with Matplotlib

### 2. German Govt. Portal Scraper

In this project, I developed a data analysis solution using Python to uncover insights from the German government portal's data on insolvency proceedings and announcements. I utilized web scraping tools like Selenium and BeautifulSoup to efficiently collect relevant data. Using Pandas, I organized and cleaned the data for meaningful analysis.

By enriching the dataset with information about the population of cities and regions, I created insightful visualizations to better understand the insolvency landscape. These visualizations, including bar charts and geographical scatter plots, provide a clear overview of insolvency rates and counts across cities and states in Germany.

To ensure a lightweight and efficient testing process, I chose Plotly's visualizations, which offer interactivity and easy exploration of the geospatial data. This approach allowed me to quickly generate visual representations of insolvency data on a map and gain insights into regional trends.

In essence, this project exemplifies a simple case of step-by-step process of gaining, cleaning, manipulating, analyzing, and visualizing data.

- **Skills:** Data Scraping with Selenium and BeautifulSoup, Data Manipulation with Pandas, Data Visualisation with Plotly and Matplotlib

### 3. News Headlines Search Engine

For this project, I performed analysis on news articles to extract relevant trends and insights. To make it user-friendly, I created a simple widget using wxPython and integrated the results with Google Sheets for easy access and collaboration. By leveraging NLTK and spaCy for data cleaning and text analysis, I enabled users to efficiently navigate and discover important information within news headlines.

- **Skills:** Data Cleaning and Text Analysis with NLTK and spaCy, UI with wxPython, Data Storing with Google Cloud Console

### 4. German Doctor Availability Statistics

Developed a web scraper to gather available doctors' data in each city from a prominent German online platform used for booking doctor's appointments, organizing the scraped data for further analysis and potential insights. 

- **Skills:** Pandas, Selenium, BeautifulSoup, Database Management

### 5. Data Visualization with Tableau

I created interactive data visualizations using Tableau to showcase key insights from a retail dataset. Through visual storytelling, I effectively communicated trends and patterns to both technical and non-technical audiences. This project highlights my data visualization skills and ability to convey complex information in an engaging manner.

- **Skills:** Data Visualization, Tableau, Storytelling

Thank you for visiting my portfolio. I'm excited about the opportunity to contribute my skills and expertise to data-driven projects and to continue learning and growing in the field of Data Science. If you have any questions or would like to collaborate, please don't hesitate to get in touch!
