## Projects

### 1. Virus Spread Simulation & Animation

In this project, I developed a virus spread simulation using object-oriented programming principles. I utilized Matplotlib to create animated visualizations that effectively demonstrated the dynamics of virus propagation. By applying my programming skills and data visualization techniques, I was able to provide an insightful and educational tool for understanding the spread of infectious diseases.

- **Skills:** Object-oriented Programming, Matplotlib, Data Visualisation

### 2. News Headlines Search Engine

For this project, I performed analysis on news articles to extract relevant trends and insights. To make it user-friendly, I created a simple widget using wxPython and integrated the results with Google Sheets for easy access and collaboration. By leveraging NLTK and spaCy for data cleaning and text analysis, I enabled users to efficiently navigate and discover important information within news headlines.

- **Skills:** NLTK, spaCy, wxPython, Google Cloud Console, Text Analysis

### 3. German Govt. Portal Scraper

In this project, I developed a simple web scraper targeting the German government portal that provides information about insolvency proceedings and announcements. By utilizing Pandas for data manipulation and cleaning, as well as Selenium and BeautifulSoup for web scraping, I efficiently collected and organized relevant data. The project also involved creating pivots and visualizations to derive meaningful insights from the gathered information.

- **Skills:** Pandas, Selenium, BeautifulSoup, Database Management

### 4. German Doctor Availability Statistics

Developed a web scraper to gather available doctors' data in each city from a prominent German online platform used for booking doctor's appointments, organizing the scraped data for further analysis and potential insights. 

- **Skills:** Pandas, Selenium, BeautifulSoup, Database Management

### 5. Data Visualization with Tableau

I created interactive data visualizations using Tableau to showcase key insights from a retail dataset. Through visual storytelling, I effectively communicated trends and patterns to both technical and non-technical audiences. This project highlights my data visualization skills and ability to convey complex information in an engaging manner.

- **Skills:** Data Visualization, Tableau, Storytelling

Thank you for visiting my portfolio. I'm excited about the opportunity to contribute my skills and expertise to data-driven projects and to continue learning and growing in the field of Data Science. If you have any questions or would like to collaborate, please don't hesitate to get in touch!
